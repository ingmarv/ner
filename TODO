TODO
====

- Configurable key bindings: allow the user to configure which bindings they
  want to use.
- Configurable UI.
- Faster scrolling in search-list-view
- search-view loads a lot slower when a search generates a lot of results
- Handle Xapian errors rather than crashing.
- Handle sendmail errors rather than crashing. Currently when sendmail fails
  (or doesn't exist) ner will crash.
- Message tagging support.
- GPG support.
- Message color highlighting (signature, reply levels, etc).
- Add the ability to reload configuration.
- Pipe message parts to command
- Make EmailView more interactive, adding things like:
    - The ability to fold quoted parts and signatures
    - Saving attachments
    - Maybe specifying which part of a multipart/alternative message to display
